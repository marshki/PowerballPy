- [ ] In the white_numbers() and red_number() functions, you don't need to convert the generated numbers to strings and then join them with commas. Instead, you could just return the list of numbers.

- [ ] You could consider adding some unit tests to make sure that the functions are working correctly.

- [ ] You may want to add some comments to your code to make it more clear and easier to understand.
